Feature: Replace_Profanity_With_Asterisks
	As a person who is a little bit delicate
    I would like to have words of profanity hidden from incomming text
    So that I can get on with my life without fainting


Background:
    Given The profanity removing API is available
    And I am using the profanity replacement service


@notsweary
Scenario Outline: No_Profanity_Removed
	When I receive an incomming text of "<text>"
    And I replace profanitys in the content
    Then no asterisks are added 

Examples:
| text              |
| hello, you mother |     
| you are a ferret  |

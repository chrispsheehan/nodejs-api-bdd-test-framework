Feature: Replace_Profanity_With_Character
	As a person who is a little bit delicate
    I would like to have words of profanity replaced with some characters
    So that I am not exposed to bad things


Background:
    Given The profanity removing API is available

Scenario Outline: No_Profanity_Replaced_With_Character
    Given I am using the profanity character replacement service with "<replacementCharacter>"
	When I receive an incomming text of "<text>"
    And I replace profanitys in the content
    Then the "<text>" remains unchanged

Examples:
    | replacementCharacter  | text              |
    | _                     | hello, you mother | 
    | ~                     | you are a ferret  |

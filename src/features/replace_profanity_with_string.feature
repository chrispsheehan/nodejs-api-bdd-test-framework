Feature: Replace_Profanity_With_String
	As a person who is a little bit delicate
    I would like to have words of profanity replaced with something nice in incomming texts
    So that I can ignore all the negativity


Background:
    Given The profanity removing API is available

Scenario Outline: No_Profanity_Replaced_With_String
    Given I am using the profanity string replacement service with "<replacementString>"
    When I receive an incomming text of "<text>"
    And I replace profanitys in the content
    Then the "<text>" remains unchanged

Examples:
    | replacementString     | text              |
    | lovelyness            | hello, you mother |  
    | warm hugs             | you are a ferret  |
